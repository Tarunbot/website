Flux Legacy and Helm Operator have [been
archived](/blog/2022/10/september-2022-update/#flux-legacy-v1-retirement-plan).

We strongly recommend you familiarise yourself with the newest Flux and [migrate as soon as possible](/flux/migration/).

If you still need migration help, there are still [free migration
workshops](https://bit.ly/FluxMigrationSurvey), or reach out for paid
support to one of the companies [listed here](/support/#my-employer-needs-additional-help).
